# Social Commerce Page Analysis Tool

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a tool to analyze the atmospherics and influencer impact on purchase intention in social commerce. This involves collecting data from social commerce pages, performing sentiment analysis, and visualizing the influence of different atmospherics and influencers on purchase intentions.

## Features
1. **Web Scraper for Collecting Social Commerce Page Data**
   - Collects data such as text, images, likes, comments, and shares from social commerce pages.
   - Utilizes BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for web scraping.

2. **Sentiment Analysis to Evaluate Page Aesthetics and Interactions**
   - Analyzes the sentiment of text data from social commerce pages.
   - Uses NLP libraries such as NLTK and SpaCy to perform sentiment analysis.

3. **Data Visualization of the Influence of Different Atmospherics and Influencers on Purchase Intentions**
   - Visualizes the collected data to show the impact of various atmospherics and influencers on purchase intentions.
   - Utilizes Matplotlib or Plotly for data visualization.

## Technologies
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, SpaCy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Programming Language**: Python
